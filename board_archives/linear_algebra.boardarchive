First,we are to express the vectors in matrix form,followed by finding the echelon form of the resulting matrix. Finally,we need to determine whether the given vectors are linearly dependent or linearly independent. By completing these steps,we can analyze the properties of the vectors and explore their linear relationships.","r128awqc-yltw-attx-iisq-aidv1yi8zpp1":"","0mfhm1np-c0tb-e5pl-rcv8-b1v9vz4tzwvt":"1h6hbnqntfreixu44zpf174y9y","4w3qgq7k-ixmt-gaw6-yh0z-nsx9shkwuhmq":"","zl0tjm3w-6yud-8eph-5ce2-3d9q1exwzmji":"","urels3ht-sd43-d39h-k7ys-l5hn5mbs8b1e":"https://ecampus.idems.international/question/bank/history/history.php?entryid=84120&returnurl=%2Fquestion%2Fedit.php%3Fcourseid%3D247%26cat%3D11506%252C82043&courseid=247","jbye16pt-oej4-59a9-w26c-eusxvny851bj":""},"contentOrder":[],"isTemplate":false},"title":"Writing the matrix and echelon form of a vector and showing if they are linearly independent or dependent","createAt":1691962472328,"updateAt":1691962472328,"deleteAt":0,"limited":false}}
